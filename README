NAME
    WebService::Pushover - interface to Pushover API

VERSION
    This document describes WebService::Pushover version 0.1.2.

SYNOPSIS
        use WebService::Pushover;

        my $push = WebService::Pushover->new
            or die( "Unable to instantiate WebService::Pushover.\n" );

        my %params = (
            token => 'PUSHOVER API TOKEN',
            user => 'PUSHOVER USER TOKEN',
            message => 'test test test',
        );

        my $status = $push->message( %params );

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a Perl wrapper around the Pushover (
    <http://pushover.net> ) RESTful API. You'll need to register with
    Pushover to obtain an API token for yourself and for your application
    before you'll be able to do anything with this module.

INTERFACE
    new()
        Accepts a single parameter, "debug". Set this to a true value in
        order to enable tracing of Net::HTTP::Spore operations.

    debug()
        *debug()* returns 1 if debugging is enabled, and 0 otherwise.

    message(*%params*)
        *message()* sends a message to Pushover and returns a scalar
        reference representation of the message status. The following are
        valid parameters:

        token REQUIRED
            The Pushover application token, obtained by registering at
            <http://pushover.net/apps>.

        user REQUIRED
            The Pushover user token, obtained by registering at
            <http://pushover.net>.

        device OPTIONAL
            The Pushover device name; if not supplied, the user will be
            validated if at least one device is registered to that user.

        title OPTIONAL
            A string that will appear as the title of the message; if not
            supplied, the name of the application registered to the
            application token will appear.

        message REQUIRED
            A string that will appear as the body of the message.

        timestamp OPTIONAL
            The desired message timestamp, in Unix epoch seconds.

        priority OPTIONAL
            Set this value to "2" to mark the message as emergency priority,
            "1" to mark the message as high priority, set it to "-1" to mark
            the message as low priority, or set it to "0" or leave it unset
            for standard priority.

        retry OPTIONAL
            You must pass this parameter when sending messages at emergency
            priority. Set this value to the number of seconds before
            Pushover tries again to obtain confirmation of message receipt.

        expire OPTIONAL
            You must pass this parameter when sending messages at emergency
            priority. Set this value to the number of seconds before
            Pushover stops trying to obtain confirmation of message receipt.

        url OPTIONAL
            A string that will be attached to the message as a supplementary
            URL.

        url_title OPTIONAL
            A string that will be displayed as the title of any
            supplementary URL.

        sound OPTIONAL
            Select a sound to be associated with this notification. Check
            the Pushover API documentation for valid values.

    push(*%params*)
        *push()* is a DEPRECATED alias for *message()*. It will be removed
        in a future release, but remains for backwards compatibility.

    user(*%params*)
        *user()* sends an application token and a user token to Pushover and
        returns a scalar reference representation of the validity of those
        tokens. The following are valid parameters:

        token REQUIRED
            The Pushover application token, obtained by registering at
            <http://pushover.net/apps>.

        user REQUIRED
            The Pushover user token, obtained by registering at
            <http://pushover.net>.

        device OPTIONAL
            The Pushover device name; if not supplied, the message will go
            to all devices registered to the user token.

    tokens(*%params*)
        *tokens()* is a DEPRECATED alias for *user()*. It will be removed in
        a future release, but remains for backwards compatibility.

    receipt(*%params*)
        *receipt()* sends an application token and a receipt token to
        Pushover and returns a scalar reference representation of the
        confirmation status of the notification associated with the receipt.
        The following are valid parameters:

        token REQUIRED
            The Pushover application token, obtained by registering at
            <http://pushover.net/apps>.

        receipt REQUIRED
            The Pushover receipt token, obtained by parsing the output
            returned after sending a message with emergency priority.

DIAGNOSTICS
    Inspect the value returned by any method, which will be a Perl data
    structure parsed from the JSON or XML response returned by the Pushover
    API.
