NAME
       WebService::Pushover − interface to Pushover API

VERSION
       This document describes WebService::Pushover version 0.0.1

SYNOPSIS
           use WebService::Pushover;

           my $push = WebService::Pushover−>new
               or die( "Unable to instantiate WebService::Pushover.\n" );

           my %params = (
               token => 'PUSHOVER API TOKEN',
               user => 'PUSHOVER USER TOKEN',
               message => 'test test test',
           );

           my $status = $push−>push( %params );

DESCRIPTION
       This module provides a Perl wrapper around the Pushover (
       <http://pushover.net> ) RESTful API.  You’ll need to register with
       Pushover to obtain an API token for yourself and for your application
       before you’ll be able to do anything with this module.

INTERFACE
       new()
           Inherited from WebService::Simple, and takes all the same
           arguments; you shouldn’t need to pass any under normal use.

       push(%params)
           push() sends a message to Pushover and returns a scalar reference
           representation of the message status.  The following are valid
           parameters:

           token REQUIRED
               The Pushover application token, obtained by registering at
               <http://pushover.net/apps>.

           user REQUIRED
               The Pushover user token, obtained by registering at
               <http://pushover.net>.

           device OPTIONAL
               The Pushover device name; if not supplied, the message will go
               to all devices registered to the user token.

           title OPTIONAL
               A string that will appear as the title of the message; if not
               supplied, the name of the application registered to the
               application token will appear.

           message REQUIRED
               A string that will appear as the body of the message.

           timestamp OPTIONAL
               The desired message timestamp, in Unix epoch seconds.

           priority OPTIONAL
               Set this value to "1" to mark the message as high priority, or
               leave it unset for standard priority.

           url OPTIONAL
               A string that will be attached to the message as a hyperlink.

           timestamp OPTIONAL
               The desired message timestamp, in Unix epoch seconds.

           priority OPTIONAL
               Set this value to "1" to mark the message as high priority, or
               leave it unset for standard priority.

           url OPTIONAL
               A string that will appear as an supplementary URL associated
               with the message.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Inspect the value returned by push(), which will be a Perl data
       structure parsed from the JSON response returned by the Pushover API.
       Under normal operation it will contain one key, "status", with a value
       of "1"; in the event of an error, there will also be an "errors" key.
