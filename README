       This module provides a Perl wrapper around the Pushover (
       <http://pushover.net> ) RESTful API.  You'll need to register with
       Pushover to obtain an API token for yourself and for your application
       before you'll be able to do anything with this module.

IINNTTEERRFFAACCEE
       _n_e_w_(_)
           Inherited from WebService::Simple, and takes all the same
           arguments; you shouldn't need to pass any under normal use.

       push(_%_p_a_r_a_m_s)
           _p_u_s_h_(_) sends a message to Pushover and returns a scalar reference
           representation of the message status.  The following are valid
           parameters:

           token RREEQQUUIIRREEDD
               The Pushover application token, obtained by registering at
               <http://pushover.net/apps>.

           user RREEQQUUIIRREEDD
               The Pushover user token, obtained by registering at
               <http://pushover.net>.

           device OOPPTTIIOONNAALL
               The Pushover device name; if not supplied, the user will be
               validated if at least one device is registered to that user.

           title OOPPTTIIOONNAALL
               A string that will appear as the title of the message; if not
               supplied, the name of the application registered to the
               application token will appear.

           message RREEQQUUIIRREEDD
               A string that will appear as the body of the message.

           timestamp OOPPTTIIOONNAALL
               The desired message timestamp, in Unix epoch seconds.

           priority OOPPTTIIOONNAALL
               Set this value to "1" to mark the message as high priority, set
               it to "-1" to mark the message as low priority, or set it to
               "0" or leave it unset for standard priority.

           url OOPPTTIIOONNAALL
               A string that will be attached to the message as a
               supplementary URL.

           url_title OOPPTTIIOONNAALL
               A string that will be displayed as the title of any
               supplementary URL.

       tokens(_%_p_a_r_a_m_s)
           _t_o_k_e_n_s_(_) sends an application token and a user token to Pushover
           and returns a scalar reference representation of the validity of
           those tokens.  The following are valid parameters:

           token RREEQQUUIIRREEDD
               The Pushover application token, obtained by registering at
               <http://pushover.net/apps>.

           user RREEQQUUIIRREEDD
               The Pushover user token, obtained by registering at
               <http://pushover.net>.

           device OOPPTTIIOONNAALL
               The Pushover device name; if not supplied, the message will go
               to all devices registered to the user token.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
       Inspect the value returned by _p_u_s_h_(_), which will be a Perl data
       structure parsed from the JSON response returned by the Pushover API.
       Under normal operation it will contain one key, "status", with a value
       of "1"; in the event of an error, there will also be an "errors" key.
